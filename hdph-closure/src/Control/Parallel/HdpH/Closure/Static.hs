-- The 'Static' type constructor as proposed in [1] is not yet supported
-- by GHC (as of version 7.4.1). This module provides a workaround that
-- necessarily differs in some aspects. However, the type constructor 'Static'
-- itself and its eliminator 'unstatic' work exactly as proposed in [1].
--
-- Differences between 'Control.Parallel.HdpH.Closure.Static' and a builtin
-- 'Static' are:
-- o Static values must be declared at toplevel
-- o Static terms must be explicitly named (via 'staticAs')
-- o Static terms must be explicitly declared and registered before use

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Key facts about 'Static'
--
-- o We say that a term 't' /captures/ a variable 'x' if 'x' occurs free
--   in 't' and 'x' is not declared at the top-level. (That is, this notion
--   of capture is sensitive to the context.)
--
-- o We call a term 't' /static/ if it could be declared at the top-level,
--   that is if does not capture any variables. In contrast, we call a
--   term /Static/ if it is of type 'Static t' for some type 't'.
--
-- o In principle, a term 'stat' of type 'Static t' acts as serialisable
--   reference to a static term of type 't'. However, here we realise
--   terms of type 'Static t' as a triple consisting of such a serialisable
--   reference (an index in the global Static table), a reference name
--   (a unique label of type String) and the refered-to static term itself.
--
-- o Only the serialisable reference is actually serialised when a Static term 
--   'stat' is serialised. The link between that reference and the associated 
--   Static term 'stat' is established by a registry, the /Static table/,
--   mapping indices to /registered/ Static terms.
--
-- o There are two ways of obtaining a term 'stat :: Static t'. By introducing
--   it with the smart constructor 'staticAs', or by deserialising it.
--   The latter assumes that the Static table has been initialised before
--   and has been initialised identically across all nodes; failing this
--   requirement may result in horrible crashes.
--
-- o Applications using this module (even indirectly) must go through two
--   distinct phases: 
--   (1) Introduce and register all Static terms (of which, by their nature, 
--       there can only be a statically bounded number) but do neither
--       serialise nor deserialise any Static terms. 
--   (2) Serialise and Deserialise Static terms at will but do not attempt
---      to register any new Static terms.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- How to register Static terms
--
-- Every module which introduces Static terms via 'staticAs' must export
-- a term 'declareStatic :: StaticDecl' for declaring these terms. The
-- main module must import all these 'declareStatic' terms, concat them 
-- to form a global Static declaration, and register that declaration.
--
-- To demonstrate the simplest example, suppose module 'M1' introduces two
-- Static terms (as top-level variables).
-- 
-- > x_Static :: Static Int
-- > x_Static = staticAs 42 "Fully_Qualified_Name_Of_M1.x"
-- >
-- > f_Static :: Static ([a] -> Int)
-- > f_Static = staticAs f "Fully_Qualified_Name_Of_M1.f"
-- >   where
-- >     f []     = 0
-- >     f (_:xs) = 1 + f xs
--
-- Then 'M1' ought to export
--
-- > declareStatic :: StaticDecl
-- > declareStatic = Data.Monoid.mconcat
-- >                   [declare x_Static,
-- >                    declare f_Static]
--
-- Now suppose module 'M3' imports 'M1'. It doesn't matter whether 'M3'
-- imports the Static terms of 'M1' directly; any function exported by
-- 'M1' may depend on its Static terms being registered, so 'M3' must
-- ensure that registration happens. Suppose further that 'M3' also imports
-- a module 'M2' which requires some other Static terms to be registered,
-- and that 'M3' itself introduces a term 'x_Static :: Static Bool'
-- (eg. by 'x_Static = staticAs True "Fully_Qualified_Name_Of_M3.x").
-- In this case, 'M3' ought to export the following
--
-- > declareStatic :: StaticDecl
-- > declareStatic = Data.Monoid.mconcat
-- >                   [M1.declareStatic,
-- >                    M2.declareStatic,
-- >                    declare x_Static]
--
-- Note that 'M2' may import 'M1' and so the definition of 'M2.declareStatic'
-- may contain a call to 'M1.declareStatic', in which case the above 'mconcat'
-- would process the data in 'M1.declareStatic' twice. This is of no concern,
-- thanks to the defintion of 'mconcat', as long as the reference name
-- (the second argument of 'staticAs') of each Static term is unique.
--
-- The 'Main' module must define a term 'declareStatic', similar to
-- 'M3.declareStatic' above. This term must then be passed to 'register'
-- right at the start of the 'main' action.
--
-- > main :: IO ()
-- > main = do
-- >   register declareStatic
-- >   ...
--
-- The module 'Control.Parallel.HdpH.Closure' offers more convenient support
-- for declaring and registering Static terms linked to explicit closures.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Static terms (abstract outwith this module)
--
-- NOTE: Static labels are hyperstrict.
--       Static terms are strict in their label part.
--       Static terms are not strict in their index part, the evaluation
--       of which is delayed until the Static term is scrutinised, eg. by
--       comparisons or by serialisation. However, a Static term
--       produced by deserialisation is strict in its index part.

-- Constructs a 'StaticLabel' out of a name 'nm' (which is usually a fully
-- qualified toplevel variable name).
-- This constructor ensures that the resulting 'StaticLabel' is hyperstrict;
-- this constructor is not to be exported.
-- NOTE: Hyperstrictness is guaranteed by the strictness flags in the data
--       declaration of 'StaticLabel'. For the 'hash' field this already
--       implies full normalisation, computing the hash also fully normalises
--       the 'name' field.
mkStaticLabel :: String -> StaticLabel
mkStaticLabel nm = StaticLabel { hash = hashString nm, name = nm }


-- Constructs a Static term referring to the given static value 'val'
-- and identified by the given reference name 'nm'.
-- NOTE: Strictness flag on 'label' forces that field to WHNF (which conincides
--       with NF due to hyperstrictness of 'StaticLabel').
staticAs :: a -> String -> Static a
staticAs val nm =
  Static { label = lbl, index = findIndex lbl, unstatic = val }
    where
      lbl = mkStaticLabel nm

-- Binary/Serialize instances for 'Static'

instance Binary (Static a) where
  put = Data.Binary.put . index
  get = resolve <$> Data.Binary.get

instance Serialize (Static a) where
  put = Data.Serialize.put . index
  get = resolve <$> Data.Serialize.get
        -- NOTES:
        -- o Hyperstrictness is enforced by 'resolve' (and by construction
        --   of the Static table).
        -- o Serialisation crashes if the Static term is not yet registered.
        -- o Deserialisation crashes if the index passed to 'resolve' is
        --   out of bounds (but that can only happen when deserialising
        --   a bytestring that wasn't generated from a registered Static term).


-- Resolves an index obtained from deserialisation into a Static term
-- by accessing the index in the global Static table; assumes that the
-- index is in bounds.
resolve :: StaticIndex -> Static a
resolve i =
  case (unsafePerformIO $ readIORef sTblRef) ! i of
    Any stat -> unsafeCoerce stat

-- Why 'unsafeCoerce' in safe in 'resolve':
--
-- o Static terms can only be introduced by the smart constructor 'staticAs'.
--
-- o We assume that the 'label' part of a Static term (as constructed by 
--   'staticAs') is a /key/.  That is, whenever terms 'stat1 :: Static t1' 
--   and 'stat2 :: Static t2' are introduced by 'staticAs' such that 
--   'label stat1 == label stat2' then 'unstatic stat1 :: t1' is identical 
--   to 'unstatic stat2 :: t2' (which also implies that the types 't1' and 
--   't2' are identical). This assumption is justified if labels are
--   derived from fully qualified top-level names.
--
-- o Likewise, we assume that the 'index' part of a Static term is a /key/.
--   This follows from 'label' being a key and from the way the Static table
--   is constructed by 'register'.
--
-- o Thus, we can safely super-impose (using 'unsafeCoerce') the return type
--   'Static a' of 'resolve' on the returned Static term. This type will
--   have been dictated by the calling context of 'resolve', ie. by the
--   calling context of deserialisation.
